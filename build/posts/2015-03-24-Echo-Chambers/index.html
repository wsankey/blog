			<h4>“If you live near a Whole Foods,” he said. “If no relative of yours serves in the military; If you’re paid by the year, not the hour; If no one you know uses meth; If you married once and remain married; If most people you know finished college; If you aren’t one of 65 million Americans with a criminal record. If any or all of these things describe you, then accept the possibility that, actually, you may not know what’s going on, and you may be part of the problem.”</h4>
<p><em>Anand Giridharadas</em></p>
<p>I am regularly impressed by twitter. Tens of millions of people across
the world communicating together on one platform. Ideas, opinions, and
perspectives pour into the platform at all times of day. It's easy to
find your community online, and it's easy to participate in the
discussion.</p>
<p>There is another twitter, and perhaps others across the world. The one I
have in mind is called Sina-Weibo and it caters to the Eastern world,
particularly China.</p>
<p>These two twitters rarely, if ever, interact. There is the obvious
barrier of language but that is something we can overcome from both
sides with the tools of online translation. Yet it is hard to imagine
these two worlds combining into one. And so we in the West will suffer
from limited access to those ideas and perspectives from the East...at
least for a little bit longer.</p>
<h3>Have you mapped your social network, do you know the makeup of it's participants?</h3>
<p>I have the sneaking suspicion that most of our social networks are filled with people who for ook and think like us. Are in a similar age, demographic,
and socioeconomic bracket. Perhaps unknowingly we drift towards people
who represent who we are--it's comfortable, but it's limiting our perspectives.</p>
<p>And this has potentially serious outcomes, certainly from limiting our
cultural and personal growth but more insidiously, as a society, we recycle
the same solutions to problems we face. We ignore problems others are
facing because we are ignorant of them. We construct our realities from
the information we receive in part from our peers.</p>
<h3>The key idea here is that insular communities tend to recycle their ideas.</h3>

<li><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/02/20/mapping-twitter-topic-networks-from-polarized-crowds-to-community-clusters/">The Pew Research Center found twitter users found clusters of
  political converations where individuals do not engage other ideas</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/02/20/mapping-twitter-topic-networks-from-polarized-crowds-to-community-clusters/">We become unaware of the wider economic realities surrounding us</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/stupid-iphone-apps-2011-6">We come up with solutions to our own problems when we might be able to
  use our talents elsewhere.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is happening in our political sphere (the likeliest candidates for our next presidential election are Clinton and Bush). It has existed in our neighborhoods. And requires
purposefully action to combat.</p>

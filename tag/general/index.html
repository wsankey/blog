Viable Product. The idea behind the MVP is to knock out as quickly as
you possibly can the idea you've had in the back of your mind. Once
you've identified the need you are going to fill, the problem you are
going to solve, or the technology you are going to introduce go ahead
and move as fast as your will can travel to producing the most minimal
item you can that you are not embarrased to show off.</p>

				<div class="mainpagetext" style="overflow: hidden"><p>I regularly listen to Dan Benjamin on the 5by5.tv network and for each show he'll sell the audience on a couple of sponsorships. Usually I tune out while he reads them off but one of his newest sponsors had me listening attentively. The sponsor was the <a href="https://www.fivefourclothing.com/new/">Five Four Club</a> a service for men who don't like to shop for clothes. I don't need this service but if I had enough spare capital lying around I might participate in it. It wasn't the product exactly that I was interested in, what struck me was the fact that a legitimate company could be formed around sending men clothes each month in the mail.</p>
<p>For a person who has only ever bought clothes from a physical store after spending an annoying amount of time going, parking, trying on, reselving, talking to sales people, deciding on color, deciding on price, etc. For a person so used to that traditional model to realize that a company can be formed around sending clothes <strong>each month</strong> to men who have never tried these items on served as a realization. Specifically that </p>
<h2>all traditional service models can be reshaped by these contemporary forces.</h2>
<p>In a very real way. </p>
<p>Dan also regularly recommends other monthly services that
deliver straight to your home so you don't have to go to crowded stores
and wade through the plethora of substandard projects -- examples of
these delivery services range from <a href="https://www.harrys.com/">razors from Harrys</a> to
<a href="https://casper.com/">mattresses from Casper</a>. And there are abundant other examples: <a href="https://www.freshdirect.com/welcome.jsp">in certain cities there are food delivery
services</a>. In almost all cities across the United States there are ride
sharing services, think <a href="http://www.zipcar.com/">ZipCar</a> or <a href="https://www.car2go.com/en/austin/">Car2Go</a>. But why not just <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a> it or even bike around using a bike sharing service. You can book a room easily with <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a> and find a date from a range of apps.</p>
<p>There has been a lot written about these changing trends. But it wasn't
until I heard Dan read about a service that will send men new clothes
each month to wear that I was shocked by the reality of it. All
traditional services that can be remade <strong>will</strong> be remade.  </p></div>

<p><em>To waste one's time attempting to do the impossible. Scope is too big to do in one project. Break it up into more than one Donâ€™t try to solve every problem at once. Identify a couple, address them, and move on. You're wasting my time. You might as well be boiling the ocean.</em><br>

<p>When you first start thinking about data science projects you might be
tempted to undertake a project with too wide a scope. Here are some
examples of projects with scopes that are far too wide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Predicting future economic activity of Maryland</li>
<li>Determining which foods are associated with cancer</li>
<li>Ranking which clean technologies will fight climate change the most</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are some project ideas that have a limited scope:</p>
<ul>
<li>Predicting three years of economic activity for Maryland's ports</li>
<li>Conducting a meta-analysis of articles studying which foods are
  associated with cancer</li>
<li>Determining the future capacity of American made solar panels</li>
</ul></div>

<p><em>a word or custom whose variations in pronunciation or style can be used to differentiate members of ingroups from those of outgroups. Within the mindset of the ingroup, a connotation or value judgment of correct/incorrect or superior/inferior can be ascribed to the two variants.</em><br>
~Wikipedia</p>
<p>Every profession has it's own terms particular to that specialty. And it's natural that as a specialty soaks in new concepts and ideas it create these terms to detail specific ideas. There are important nuances in ideas that need to be defined and articulated; just as two different species of the Iris flower have different color patterns and petal widths so too do different model methods, data structures, and classification strategies have differences that matter. </p>
<p>However, at times it seems like new terms are created just for the purpose of creating walls. Language is a curreny between insiders passed around to the detriment of anyone who wants to join the discussion. Sometimes it seems that data science is hard because we have terms that appear to be more useful for protecting those with established titles than creating distinctions between ideas.</p>
<p>And so I encourage you, if you are willing to pursue this ambitious career to learn distinctions between terms. And once you are established, please explain your ideas in the simplest terms possible--but not simpler. </p>

				<h2><a style="font-size: 1em; font-family:'aktiv-grotesk';"href="/posts/2015-03-11-Hachi-the-dog/">Hachiko the dog</a></h2>

				<div class="mainpagetext" style="overflow: hidden"><p><em>If you don't want to read the rest of this article about Hachiko the dog
you can take away these two points:<br>
1. Hachi reflects our ideal of absolute loyalty and shows us the crippling pain of loss;<br>
2. The story is <strong>focused</strong> on death which our culture attempts to
   hide.</em></p>
<p>One of my wife's latest hobbies is following puppy and dog stories. She regularly scours <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWqONXwN2gg">dog rescue youtube videos</a> and posts pictures of cute puppies from our local rescue on Facebook and other media. Recently she's moved on to watching movies. Two days ago it was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benji_%281974_film%29">Benji movie saga</a> and yesterday it was the story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachik%C5%8D">Hachiko</a>.</p>
<p>For the unfamiliar, Hachi was a dog who saw his owner off at the train station every day since he was a pup. When he turned two years old his owner, a professor, died suddenly never to return from the train ride again. But for the next ten years the dog obediently arrived at the train station each day to wait to see if his owner would somehow come and pick him up. He waited there until his death.</p>
<p>You don't have to know anything more about this story to see now this would be a real tear-jerker of a movie. 
There is a respectable man, a professor, dying suddenly at a relatively young age. A cute young dog unexepectedly and cruelly put out on the street. There is undying loyalty and childlike ignorance of the situation.</p>
<p>Because Hachi is a dog we don't place on him the same expectations of growing, learning, and finding new life and love as we would a young child put through the same ordeal. As I mentioned in the beginning:</p>
<h3>Hachi's character synthesizes the emotions of loss and loyalty to their core.</h3>
<p>These are emotions we are free to feel because they lack the overtones that muddy our emotional waters in human stories. Nearly everyone can relate to a dog.</p>
<p>Finally, the story is <strong>focused</strong> on death which our culture attempts to hide (look around, there's evidence of this everywhere) and in it's better moments forces us to reflect on our own mortality. </p></div>

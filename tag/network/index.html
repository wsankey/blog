If any or all of these things describe you, then accept the possibility that, actually, you may not know what’s going on, and you may be part of the problem.”</h4>

<p>I am regularly impressed by twitter. Tens of millions of people across
the world communicating together on one platform. Ideas, opinions, and
perspectives pour into the platform at all times of day. It's easy to
find your community online, and it's easy to participate in the
discussion.</p>
<p>There is another twitter, and perhaps others across the world. The one I
have in mind is called Sina-Weibo and it caters to the Eastern world,
particularly China.</p>
<p>These two twitters rarely, if ever, interact. There is the obvious
barrier of language but that is something we can overcome from both
sides with the tools of online translation. Yet it is hard to imagine
these two worlds combining into one. And so we in the West will suffer
from limited access to those ideas and perspectives from the East...at
least for a little bit longer.</p>
<h3>Have you mapped your social network, do you know the makeup of it's participants?</h3>
<p>I have the sneaking suspicion that most of our social networks are filled with people who for ook and think like us. Are in a similar age, demographic,
and socioeconomic bracket. Perhaps unknowingly we drift towards people
who represent who we are--it's comfortable, but it's limiting our perspectives.</p>
<p>And this has potentially serious outcomes, certainly from limiting our
cultural and personal growth but more insidiously, as a society, we recycle
the same solutions to problems we face. We ignore problems others are
facing because we are ignorant of them. We construct our realities from
the information we receive in part from our peers.</p>
<h3>The key idea here is that insular communities tend to recycle their ideas.</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/02/20/mapping-twitter-topic-networks-from-polarized-crowds-to-community-clusters/">The Pew Research Center found twitter users found clusters of
  political converations where individuals do not engage other ideas</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/02/20/mapping-twitter-topic-networks-from-polarized-crowds-to-community-clusters/">We become unaware of the wider economic realities surrounding us</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/stupid-iphone-apps-2011-6">We come up with solutions to our own problems when we might be able to
  use our talents elsewhere.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is happening in our political sphere (the likeliest candidates for our next presidential election are Clinton and Bush). It has existed in our neighborhoods. And requires
purposefully action to combat.</p>

<p>The most frustrating and rewarding class I ever took occurred during my first semester of
my master's program and it was centered around a project. The idea for
the class, in addition to refining our writing techniques through
grueling memoranda, was to throw students into the deep end of a policy problem. We were directed to identify the conditions of
three distinct neighborhoods around Baltimore city before and after the
recession and determine how they fared.</p>
<p>Like most projects, the problem statement was innocuous enough but the execution proved a
bear. Like most innocuous problem statements this one hid layers of
competing findings, frustrating collaboration and coordination with
peers, and required making difficult decisions on design and procedure.
It kept me and my teammates up late nights, it was the cause of a few
breakdowns, and it softened our respective freshman ideas about graduate
school.</p>
<p>Experienced workers know these feelings and probably remember their
first tango working with a difficult problem on a team of competing
personalities. But for those who don't, know this:</p>
<h3>Although it is extrememly trying at times, this is the fastest and most complete way to learn.</h3>
<p>If you are hoping to become a data scientist or experienced developer, work on related
projects. Here are some ideas:</p>

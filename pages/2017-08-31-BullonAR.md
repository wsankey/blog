I recently stumbled on this [TechCrunch podcast discussing the near-term promise of augmented (AR) and virtual reality (VR)][1].

Quick thoughts:

<ul>
<li> * Though the hosts gush about AR, I agree with their points;</li></br>
<li>* VR doesn't seem like it'll get beyond hobbyist level in short run;</li></br>
<li>* The best way into AR at this time appears to be ARKit and the Swift programming language (not explicitly discussed);</li></br>
<li>* There's a potential for huge upside with machine learning in AR;</li></br>
<li>* It's incredible to think we may be at a 'beginning of the internet' point with regards to AR.</li>
</ul>
We'll need many more AR engineers than exist today so those looking to retrain and re-educate should seriously consider getting into this market.

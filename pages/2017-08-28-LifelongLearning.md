You'll often hear about the importance of livelong learning. I agree, it's important. It's important in the sense that the economy is changing. From one where you could find a stable position without a college degree to one where you can't. Many people say the economy has already changed irreparably. A few of my close friends with advanced degrees are stuck, unsatisfied and losing hope. That a [significant number of Americans live paycheck to paycheck][1] is depressing but not surprising.

The way to remain gainfully employed and to grow throughout your career is to continue your own development.

I'm lucky to work in a sector where learning resources are plentiful. Using pluralsight, coursera, udacity, codeschool, o'reilly, in-person conferences, meetup, and youtube I've cobbled together an education for myself in data science and software engineering that has paid off. I typically aim to spend 5% of my annual salary on continuing professional development. The blog you're reading now was built from these resources.

More institutions need to embrace these new modes of learning. Institutions such as Georgia Tech and the University of Illinois offer master's degrees online. I find it odd some still require things like recommendation letters  but these modes of enrollment are changing. I doubt higher learning will operate the same way in the next ten years. By the time my yet-to-be-realized children reach college it'll look a lot different.

The institutions that will win the future are those that embrace new modes of learning. The same will be true for professionals across sectors.

I urge you to spend more of your income on professional development. It'll pay off.

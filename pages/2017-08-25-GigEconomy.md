I was excited to receive a new logo for my woodworking hobby today.

<img class="parent" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='media/turnspit2.png') }}">

I paid a less than $50 sum to a designer on fivver. This was in place of asking around for a recommendation, hiring a family friend, or posting an ad in craigslist. I hired the designer on Tuesday, received the logo on Thursday, asked for two revisions <em>and that same day received the final version</em>.

Here are my thoughts after the experience:
<ol>
<li>1. Hard work still pays off</li></br>
<li>2. It's easy to hire help for the supporting tasks in your personal venture</li></br>
<li>3. Like the Alaskan wealthy, selling supplies may be more lucrative than panning for gold</li>
</ol>

And it's a great logo, no?

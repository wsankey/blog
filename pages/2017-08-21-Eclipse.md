Today I saw a partial eclipse of the sun. The moon's movements were predicted to within a minute, probably closer. It occurs to me how profound it is to have this kind of knowledge around us. To have a significant level of exertise weighing in on natural phenonmemon. And to be able to predict it and be correct in those predictions. We disrespect our experts so much these days.

I listen to a lot of podcasts and heard once again about the benefits of blogging on the latest one. It's a muscle that needs exercising and I'm terribly out of shape. It's useful though to begin again somewhere, anywhere, and wake the mind to something you want to say. Even if you don't know you want to say it when you start writing.

This eclipse happened over the U.S. only. Like some poorly written omen. That's what it felt like, an omen. There is so much to be worried about.

We should listen to our experts.
